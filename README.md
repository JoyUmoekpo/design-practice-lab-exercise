# Design Lab
Apply your new design knowledge to a novel software problem.

### Summary
- Using the same process that we used during the demo, you’re going to create at least 2 views for an ecommerce store using Figma. You’ll need to create the wireframes and mockups for each view, as well as a style guide for the whole project.

## Part 1: Wireframes

### Summary
- Create the wireframes for a individual product view and for a cart page

### Instructions
- Decide what kind of store you’ll be making (Some ideas: clothing, books, food, makeup, sports, camping gear, games, electronics, auto parts)

- Go around to a few shopping sites and see what kind of things are included on their product pages

#### Product view requirements

- Header

- At least 1 picture of the product

- Product name

- Product price

- Product description

- Buy button

- Anything else you want to include

#### Now go around and look at different cart pages and see what things you might like to put in your design

#### Cart view requirements

- Pictures of each item

- Names of each item

- Quantity of each item

- Prices of each item

- Total price

- Checkout button

- Anything else you want to include

## Part 2: Style guide

### Summary
- Create a style guide frame in your Figma workspace. Make note of all the rules you want to define about your styling.

### Instructions

- Decide on a color scheme

- Decide on a font or two

- Create layout and spacing rules

- Write icons/illustrations/picture rules

- Plan out any reusable elements (buttons or cards)

- Write other dos and don’ts of your design guide

## Part 3: Mockups

### Summary

- Now you’ll create the high fidelity mockups of your views based on the wireframes and your style guide.

- Create the basic layout

- Add in the text and images

- Tweak the sizes and spacing to match your style guide
